# Welcome to the PEACH Cancer API Server

The Peach API server is responsible for managing the non-sensitive data of the PEACH Cancer application. It is distinct from the [client application](https://github.com/JhumanJ/client), which is responsible for delivering the front-end of PEACH Cancer.

[Documentation can be found here](https://peach-cancer.gitbooks.io/api-documentation/).
